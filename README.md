Heart Attack Risk Predictor using EVAL-ML -
The Heart Attack Risk Predictor using EVAL-ML is an app designed to help predict the risk of a heart attack for individuals. This project uses various algorithms to determine the most suitable model for accurate predictions, ultimately utilizing the AutoML library EVAL-ML for the final risk assessment.


Steps -
1. Data Analysis: We thoroughly analyze the provided dataset, exploring patterns, identifying relevant features, and understanding data distributions to prepare for model training.
2. Feature Engineering: To enhance the predictive power of the models, we perform feature engineering, including data transformation, handling missing values, and creating new relevant features.
3. Standardization: Data standardization ensures that all features are on a consistent scale, preventing any particular feature from dominating the model training process.
4. Model Building: We experiment with multiple algorithms, such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines, to determine the best-performing model.
5. Predictions: Using the AutoML library EVAL-ML, we automate the model selection process and predict the risk of a heart attack for new data points with high accuracy.
