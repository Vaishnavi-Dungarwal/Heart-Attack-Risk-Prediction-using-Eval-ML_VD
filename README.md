Project Name: Heart Attack Risk Predictor using EVAL-ML

In this project we create an app which will help us predict the risk of a Heart Attack a person have.
We will do use various Algorithms to predict the result and see which one suits best and then we will use Auto ML Library EVAL ML to predict the results.

We follow following steps:
- Data Analysis 
- Feature Engineering 
- Satandardization
- Model Building
- Predictions
